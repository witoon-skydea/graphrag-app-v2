# GraphRAG Testing Report - Ollama and mxbai-embed-large

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the testing and implementation of the mxbai-embed-large model with Ollama for the GraphRAG project. The testing focused on verifying compatibility, embedding quality, and performance characteristics of the model as requested in the test plan.

**Key Findings:**
- The mxbai-embed-large model is fully compatible with the GraphRAG system when used with Ollama
- Several code adjustments were needed in the EmbeddingManager class to properly support the model
- The model produces 1024-dimensional embeddings (vs. the default 768 dimensions)
- The model shows excellent semantic understanding with a 2.9x similarity ratio between related vs. unrelated content
- Performance is very good, with embedding generation taking less than 0.1 seconds even for medium-sized texts

Based on the test results, the mxbai-embed-large model is recommended as the default embedding model for the GraphRAG system when using Ollama.

   - Testing of the mxbai-embed-large model with direct API calls
   - Implementation of necessary code changes

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Creation and execution of integration tests for the updated EmbeddingManager
   - Verification of embedding generation with the mxbai-embed-large model

4. **Performance and Quality Testing**
   - Measurement of embedding generation time
   - Evaluation of embedding quality through similarity tests
   - Comparison of embedding dimensions and characteristics

## 3. Initial Code Analysis Findings

### 3.1 EmbeddingManager Implementation

The initial analysis of the `src/embedding/embedding_manager.py` file revealed the following issues:

1. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: The Ollama API endpoint was incorrectly set to `/api/embed` instead of the correct `/api/embeddings` (plural form).

2. **Dimension Mismatch**: The default dimension for embeddings was set to 768, but the mxbai-embed-large model produces 1024-dimensional vectors.

3. **Response Format Handling**: The code only looked for an `embedding` key in the Ollama API response, but the actual API returns an `embeddings` key (plural).

4. **Default Model Selection**: The default model for Ollama was set to `llama2`, which is not specialized for embeddings.

### 3.2 Missing Test Coverage

There were no existing tests for the EmbeddingManager component, which made it difficult to verify its functionality with different models.

## 4. Implementation Changes

The following changes were made to address the identified issues:

### 4.1 API Endpoint Correction

Updated the API endpoint for Ollama from `/api/embed` to `/api/embeddings`:

```python
if embedding_source == "ollama":
    self.api_endpoint = "http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings"  # Fixed endpoint to use plural form
```

### 4.2 Dimension Adjustment

Added code to set the correct dimension for the mxbai-embed-large model:

```python
# Set dimensions based on model
if embedding_source == "ollama" and self.model_name == "mxbai-embed-large":
    self.dimensions = 1024  # mxbai-embed-large has 1024 dimensions
```

### 4.3 Response Format Handling

Updated the `_get_ollama_embedding` method to handle both `embedding` and `embeddings` keys in the response:

```python
# Handle both 'embedding' and 'embeddings' keys in the response
if "embedding" in result:
    return self._normalize_vector(result["embedding"])
elif "embeddings" in result:
    # Extract the first embedding if it's an array
    embeddings = result["embeddings"]
    if len(embeddings) > 0:
        if isinstance(embeddings[0], list):
            return self._normalize_vector(embeddings[0])
        else:
            return self._normalize_vector(embeddings)
    else:
        logger.error("Ollama API returned empty embeddings array")
        raise ValueError("Ollama API returned empty embeddings array")
```

### 4.4 Default Model Update

Changed the default model for Ollama from `llama2` to `mxbai-embed-large`:

```python
if not self.model_name:
    if embedding_source == "ollama":
        self.model_name = "mxbai-embed-large"  # Updated default to mxbai-embed-large
    # ... other cases ...
```

### 4.5 Test Implementation

Created comprehensive tests for the EmbeddingManager:

1. **Basic Functionality Test**: Verifies that the EmbeddingManager can correctly generate embeddings with the mxbai-embed-large model.
2. **Similarity Test**: Checks that the embeddings capture semantic similarity between related texts.
3. **Performance Test**: Measures the embedding generation time for texts of different lengths.

## 5. Test Results

### 5.1 Compatibility and Functionality

The mxbai-embed-large model was successfully integrated with the EmbeddingManager. All integration tests passed, verifying that:

- The model can be loaded and used with Ollama
- The API calls return valid embeddings
- The embeddings have the expected dimensions (1024)
- The vectors are properly normalized

### 5.2 Semantic Quality

The semantic quality of the embeddings was tested by comparing the similarity between:
- Two semantically similar sentences
- Two semantically different sentences

**Results:**
- Similarity between similar sentences: 0.82
- Similarity between different sentences: 0.28
- Similarity ratio: 2.91x

This indicates that the model has a strong ability to capture semantic relationships, with similar sentences showing nearly 3 times higher similarity scores than unrelated sentences.

### 5.3 Performance

The performance of the embedding generation was tested with texts of different lengths:

**Results:**
- Short text (28 chars): ~0.07 seconds
- Medium text (296 chars): ~0.04 seconds
- Long text (888 chars): ~0.09 seconds

These results show that the mxbai-embed-large model provides fast embedding generation, even for longer texts, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## 6. Recommendations

Based on the test results, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Use mxbai-embed-large as the Default Model**: The mxbai-embed-large model should be the default choice for embedding generation with Ollama in the GraphRAG system due to its strong semantic understanding and good performance.

2. **Set Correct Dimensions**: When using the mxbai-embed-large model, ensure that the dimensions parameter is set to 1024 to match the actual output of the model.

3. **Handle API Response Format**: Maintain the updated code that handles both singular and plural forms of the embedding key in the API response to ensure compatibility with different versions of the Ollama API.

4. **Add Comprehensive Tests**: The integration tests created during this testing should be maintained and expanded to ensure continued compatibility and functionality.

## 7. Conclusion

The testing of the mxbai-embed-large model with Ollama for the GraphRAG project has been successful. The model has been integrated into the EmbeddingManager component with the necessary code changes, and its performance and quality have been verified through comprehensive testing.

The mxbai-embed-large model provides high-quality embeddings with strong semantic understanding and good performance, making it an excellent choice for the GraphRAG system. The recommended changes have been implemented and tested, ensuring that the model can be used effectively in the project.
